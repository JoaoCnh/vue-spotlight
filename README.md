# vue-spotlight

## This project was made trying to learn a bit more about Vue.js

It's a spotlight search of Magic: The Gathering cards.

This project was made in about 4 hours just to learn Vue and Vuex.

It uses [magicthegathering.io](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/) for the Magic cards API.

NOTE:

Yes I know there are some bugs that may be fixed or not. Or feel free to fix them yourself.
